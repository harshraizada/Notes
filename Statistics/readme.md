This is a repo for some of the most useful statistics notes, textbooks, courses, and resources that I used when learning statistics for data science.

# Resources: 
- **Course website** --> https://ilykei.com/course/56056046f7bd4d1900258959/lecture/5612e3167c90fd16007ddfcc/document



# Online Courses: 
- **MIT 18.6501x** --> great resources for learning about statistics. This comes in a Coursera course (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.6501x+3T2018/courseware/unit1/u1s1_whatisstats/?child=first) as well as on MIT's website (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/syllabus/), and on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZD_aij8H0). The professor, Professor Philippe Rigollet, has really energetic and informative lectures. Definitely would recommend this class to anyone looking to begin learning about stats.


# Books: 
- All of Statistics (Wasserman, Larry, 2003) -->  http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/all_of_statistics.pdf with accompanyying website http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/
